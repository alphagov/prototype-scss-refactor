GOV.UK Template, Toolkit & Elements SCSS Refactor

1. Decide on filenames and conventions
2. Take the existing code from the GOV.UK template and GOV.UK frontend toolkit and fit it into this new structure
3. Rewrite elements using BEM to give greater flexibility when using it
4. Check against all principles below

Principles

Remove duplicate resets
Use scss comments // not css comments /* */
Reduce nesting

Writing classnames:

Use single-level-deep classes wherever you can. Avoid nesting.
Avoid qualifying.
Avoid type selectors.



.namespace-thing-type



Naming conventions

More transparent.
More strict.
More informative.
Most useful in your HTML. Letâ€™s look at BEM.

--

Convention for names of sizing things

for example .button--big or .button--large?

Same for type sizes

--

Do we want to use full words or abbreviations?
for example, .btn vs .button
.nav vs .navigation

--

GOV.UK template styles

Things to do:

[ ] Compare Normalize to GOV.UK base styles and resets
// https://raw.githubusercontent.com/necolas/normalize.css/master/normalize.css
// https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template/blob/master/source/assets/stylesheets/_basic.scss

[ ] Write CSS in specificity order
[ ] Settings
    High level settings, global variables
    E.g. colour values, spacing units, globally available variables
    This layer can be used by the entire project
[ ] Tools
    Mixins and functions
    Global mixins come after the settings
    Need to come before the rest of the prohect and can affect the entire project
    e.g. globally available font sizes
    tools.typography.scss
    Decide which mixins are global ones
[ ] Generic
    Ground zero styles, normalize, resets box sizing
    the * selector for box-sizing
    This layer affects a lot of the dom
[ ] Base
    Unclasses HTML elements (type selectors)
    More explicit than the reset layer
    h1 - h6, basic links, lists
[ ] Objects
    We will work up to having this layer!!
    This is the cosmetics layer, put the media object in here.

    Try to create a generic list object
    ui-list {}
    ui-list-item {}
    Choose agnostic names

[ ] Components
    Fully designed chunks of UI
    Private mixins sit in relevant file
    This is where the ui-list becomes a product list
    .products-list {
      @include font-brand;
    }
    .products-list__item {}

[ ] Overrides, helpers and utilities
    Affect one piece of the dom at a time
    Very high specificity, usually carry !important;
    e.g. helper class
    .one-half {
      width: 50% !important;
    }
    This is the most specific.

  We are progressively adding and never undoing.
  Causes rules to trickle together and we are adding on layers, not undoing.
  Global styles happen early,

We need a way of making a familiar environment from people.

Reduce the size of the codebase.
Remove CSS which isn't being used, remove bloat and waste.

ITCSS:
- Order stylesheets from Generic to specific, this helps you manage the cascage
- You're also then doing less overriding as you move further down the set of stylesheets
- Manages source order and makes it specificity based
- Filters explicitness
- Check to see how much waste it removed (reduced number of strikethroughs for each element)
- Add documentation, if you need to edit type selectors, edit overrides, look in this layer.
- Open to extension, but closed to modification

In summary:
- Write CSS in specificity order
- All rulesets should only ever add to and inherit from other styles
- DO NOT UNDO CSS later in the stylesheet
- Overrides and helpers need to come last
This prevents a spike in the specificity graph
- Add extra layers as you need
- Media queries sit with the rules that they affect



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decisons to make:

- What to do with the font files?
- Can we fallback to PNGs in template/images and instead use SVG?
- Print stylesheet & how do the mixins for this work?
- What units do we want to use rem/em/px a combo?

Discuss: at the moment we use 15px, this means we can't vertically align things properly (can't divide by two and get a whole number)
